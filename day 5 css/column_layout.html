        A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and
        are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do
        that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.
        This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an
        essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the
        essay and grasp its main points. Paragraphs can contain many different
        kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples
        or a single long illustration of a general point. It might describe a
        place, character, or process; narrate a series of events; compare or
        contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe
        causes and effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain,
        all paragraphs share certain characteristics. One of the most important of
        these is a topic sentence.
